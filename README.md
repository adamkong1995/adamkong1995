## Hi, I’m Adam 👋

I’m a full-stack developer with **8+ years of experience building applications
with Node.js and Next.js (since 2018)**, and I enjoy designing systems that work
across boundaries — authentication, APIs, and complex domains.

I’m especially interested in:

- Identity & authentication (OIDC, SSO, cross-app auth)
- Contract-first APIs and SDK generation
- Type-safe systems in TypeScript
- Frontend architecture at scale (React, Next.js)
- Modeling complex rules and behaviors (simulations, games, engines)

### Selected projects

**Microfrontend SSO Demo**  
A portfolio demo showing how to implement Single Sign-On across multiple
independently deployed applications (Next.js, Nuxt, React) without shared
cookies or runtime.  
_Auth0, OIDC, Vercel, microfrontend architecture_

**Typed API SDK Factory**  
A reference pipeline for generating typed API clients from schema definitions,
including OpenAPI generation, SDK codegen, and automated publishing.  
_Zod, OpenAPI, hey-api, GitHub Actions_

**Tactical Combat Engine** _(WIP)_  
A TypeScript playground focused on modeling complex combat rules using
declarative effects, conditions, and explainable resolution traces.  
_Type-driven design, DSLs, simulation_

### Philosophy

I care about:

- Clear boundaries between systems
- Explicit contracts over implicit assumptions
- Tooling that helps teams move faster without breaking things

Most of my work is inspired by real production problems, simplified into
small, explainable demos.
